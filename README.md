# Examples of Enterprise Integration Patterns in Google Cloud Platform

This repository contains example imples of the enterprise integration patterns from the [seminal book](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. The examples are written in Go and use
features of the Google Cloud Platform.

The project is inspired by [Gregor Hohpe](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/eip1_examples_updated.html).

Each pattern can be found in its own directory in the examples folder. See the contained readme.md for more details.
